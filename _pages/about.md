Hi there! My name is Zhengyi Luo (my friends call me Zen) and I am a second year master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, advised by Prof.[**Kris Kitani**](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/). I earned my Bachelors's degree from University of Pennsylvania in 2019, where I worked with Prof.[**Kostas Daniilidis**](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). 

My research interest stems from my love for AR/VR, and lies at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. Currently, I am working on topcis including human motion prediction, human motion generation, object motion estimation, etc.
