Hi there! My name is Zhengyi Luo (my friends call me Zen) and I am a second year reserach master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science, advised by Prof. <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/"><u>Kris Kitani</u></a>. I earned my bachelor's degree from University of Pennsylvania in 2019, where I worked with Prof. <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/"><u>Kostas Daniilidis</u></a>.

My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I am working on topcis including human pose estimation, human-object interaction estimation, human motion generation etc. Through my research, I want to create methods that effectively interpret spatial-temporal sensory input and build a compositional representation of the 3D world to reason about the interactions between agents and the physical environment. On the application side, I am excited about building systems that would be useful as assistive robots, autonomous vehicles, and AR/VR virtual assistants.

<!-- I am applying for Ph.D. for Fall 2021! If you find my profile interesting, you can leave your email here: <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="https://forms.gle/5kCgzrNSBZSbufPr7">link</a> and I can reach out to you or feel free to reach out to me at zluo2 [at] cs.cmu.edu! -->
I will (re)join Robotics Institute as a Phd Student Fall 2021!
